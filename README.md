# Automation-with-DTMF-Dual-Tone-Multi-Frequency-Technology
Dual Tone Multi-Frequency as the name specifies each tone is associated with two frequencies(Dual). This technology is used in the telephone communication system. With this technology, each number keys used in mobile phones from 1-9 have two different frequencies which are different from each other. 
In this project, we will use DTMF receiver IC which will detect the tone generated from the mobile phone and also convert it into its equivalent binary digit. For example, 1 is converted to 0001 and 8 as 1000. Now through Arduino IDE with appropriate code, this binary digits can be used to control the digital pins on Arduino or any microcontroller or can be used as output to ohter ICs. For example, Motor Driver IC can be controlled with these binary codes to control motors or a small RC car.
